This repositary contains different types of result images of a deep image prior network.
(all images are from the Kodak data set)

The result images contain:
- images after 2000 epochs (2000_epoch_imgs)
- top images using the oracle (oracle_imgs)
- an image result from averaging last 50 images (average_50_imgs)

The result images for other methods:
- images produced with bilinear interpolation (bilinear_imgs)
- images produced with Malvar's demosaicing method (malvar_imgs)
- images produced with Menon's demosaicing method (menon_imgs)
